# Pelion
## Deployment
This was deployed to GitHub Pages but the user must call `https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity` directly from browser first and accept risks as it is HTTP before 
it can be called from within the app on GitHub pages.

## Setup
Run `npm i -g @angular/cli@12.2.17` in cmd.
Navigate to inside the `pelion` folder within cmd and run `npm i` and then `ng serve`
Go to `http://localhost:4200`

## Future Improvements
- Add a history of previous activity results stored within local storage.
- Add a Like feature so the user can keep a catalog of liked activities stored within local storage.
- Create a config file to hold all the SASS variables in.
- Allow better precision over price and accessibility range using slider.
